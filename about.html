  	<h2 id = "coronavirus"> Why this website?</h2>
      <p id = "paragraph1">During this pandemic, space (specifically between
        people) is more important than ever! We wanted to combine our love for
        space with a concept that would help people socially distance during
        these uncertain times.</p>

  	<h2 id = "why_us"> What is it?</h2>
      <p id = "paragraph2">The website tracks the user's location and displays
        it on a map as their character (an astronaut). The game itself is
        activated if they are inside of a store, which is displayed as a
        spaceship on the map. From there, they choose if they are on the red
        team (Mars) or the blue team (Neptune). They then can earn points
        through two different features. First, they can get "stardust", where
        the amount decreases as time goes on, by making their trip to the store
        short and sweet. Second, they can earn points by indicating that they
        are wearing a mask (their spacesuit) inside of the store. If they're at
        home, they're on "Earth", meaning that they can access the website and
        look at information, but can't play the game itself. We hope that this
        game is a fun way to encourage people to social distance and wear masks
        while grocery shopping and running essential errands!</p>
